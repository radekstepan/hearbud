## Setup

Before you can run the application, you need two things installed on your computer:

1.  **Python**: Make sure Python is installed. You can get it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). During installation, make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**.
2.  **FFmpeg**: This is required for saving the audio as an MP3.
    -   Download it from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
    -   Unzip the file.
    -   Add the `bin` folder from the unzipped contents to your system's PATH.

## How to Run

1.  Download the project files.
2.  Double-click the **`run.bat`** file.

This script will automatically create a virtual environment, install the necessary Python packages, and then start the application for you. The first time you run it, it might take a minute to install everything.
